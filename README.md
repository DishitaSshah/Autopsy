# Autopsy
A Digital Forensics security tool

Autopsy is an open-source digital forensics tool used by law enforcement, military, and corporate investigators to analyze digital evidence efficiently. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface for The Sleuth Kit (TSK), which is a suite of command-line forensic tools. Autopsy allows forensic analysts to recover deleted files, analyze disk images, extract metadata, and investigate cybercrimes effectively. 

Features we implemented- 

1.	Deleted Data Searching and Recovery - Autopsy is equipped with powerful file recovery capabilities that allow forensic analysts to retrieve deleted files from NTFS, FAT, and EXT file systems. Even if files have been fragmented or partially overwritten, Autopsy can reconstruct missing data directories and retrieve usable information from allocated and unallocated disk space.
2.	Keyword Search - The tool supports both indexed and live keyword searches, allowing investigators to find specific terms hidden within files, system logs, browser history, and unallocated space. Custom keyword lists can be used to refine searches for specific investigations, helping analysts detect suspicious activities quickly.
3.	Data Extraction - Autopsy extracts essential information from various sources, including emails, documents, images, and browser histories. It retrieves metadata such as timestamps, author details, and GPS coordinates, helping investigators analyze user activities, file origins, and potential security incidents.
4.	Timeline Analysis - The tool generates an interactive timeline of file modifications, deletions, system events, and user activities. This helps forensic investigators visualize the chronological order of events, making it easier to identify suspicious actions and reconstruct digital crime scenes.
5.	Report Generation - Autopsy automatically generates forensic reports summarizing key findings, extracted artifacts, keyword search results, and system analysis outcomes. These reports are essential for legal proceedings, compliance audits, and cybersecurity assessments.
